# Final Project

The application I am working with is a simple Tic Tac Toe Game web-based
application. This project uses some of the DevOps practices we've leaned
to build a complete automated software delivery process with pipelines.

## Used Practices

- Phases of SDLC: they are integrated into the project, and include
planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
- Source control: the project is build within this Git repository,
using branching, commits, workflows and other
- Branching strategies: they are used for organized development with
bug-free code
- Building Pipelines
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Security
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## Additional Information

- The pipeline starts with a git repository
- The solution is T-shaped or E-shaped â€“ where we have a nice working
horizontal + at
least one deep dive vertical
- Where possible, the solution is as code
- The documentation of the project is described here
- The tools that are used are: Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes

## Process

- Project Planning: understand the requirements and expectations, create
a project plan, choose which practices to include in my project
  The practices that are included in the solution of the project are:
Phases of SDLC, Source control, Branching strategies, Building Pipelines,
Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Security, Docker, Kubernetes.
  SDLC phase: planning phase
- Source control: set up a Git repository for the project
  This repository is set up by forking the repository with the Tic Tac Toe
application sorce code.
  SDLC phase: planning phase
- Branching strategies: choose a branching strategy that fits my project
  I chose to have one branch for developing the automated software delivery
process, and merge it to the main branch when needed.
  SDLC phase: planning phase
