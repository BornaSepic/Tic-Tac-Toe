# Final Project
The application I am working with is a simple Tic Tac Toe Game web-based application. This project uses some of the DevOps practices we've leaned to build a complete automated software delivery process with pipelines. 

### Used Practices
● Phases of SDLC
● Source control
● Branching strategies
● Building Pipelines
● Continuous Integration
● Continuous Delivery
● Security
● Docker
● Kubernetes

### Additional Information
● The pipeline starts with a git repository
● The solution is T-shaped or E-shaped – where we have a nice working horizontal + at
least one deep dive vertical
● Where possible, the solution is as code
● Documentation is part of the solution
● Mandatory components - Continuous Integration, Deploy to Kubernetes
● Use any tool you like
