## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing
[Issues](https://github.com/ivn-maria/Modern-DevOps-Practices/issues) that
might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need
clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable
to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we
recommend the following:

- Open an
[Issue](https://github.com/ivn-maria/Modern-DevOps-Practices/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what
seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect
information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete
the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as
possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g.
using incompatible environment components/versions. If you are looking for
support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
for your bug or error in the [bugtracker](https://github.com/ivn-maria/Modern-DevOps-Practicesissues?q=label%3Abug)
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if
users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package
manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with
older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with
the project:

- Open an
[Issue](https://github.com/ivn-maria/Modern-DevOps-Practices/issues/new).
(Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you
not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction
steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This
usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the
team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs
with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as
well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`).
